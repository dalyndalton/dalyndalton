## Work Experience
### TA (Intro to C) | 2021 - Fall 2022

For two semesters, I've been a TA for the Electrical engineering intro to programming course, intro to C.  Here I've worked as both a mentor and a grader; helping coach students through finding a solution, debugging very obscure bugs on multiple systems, and developing the unit test and shell scripts required to grade all of their assignments

Related Skills: C, C++, Communication

### Utah LTAP (USU Civil) | 2020 - Current

Role: GIS Coordinator | Software Developer

Lead (and only) developer for our proprietary traffic asset management system.  Have overseen the migration from an old desktop tool to a cloud based system, and have developed the solution to bridge the gaps and asset calculations.
This has been done through a combination of analyzing the old C# application, and rewriting many of the system in ArcPy, a python subset of ArcGIS tools.  In addition to development, I have also been the company's IT admin, managing the small team of 5-6 employees.
